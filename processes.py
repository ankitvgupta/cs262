# processes.py: Implements logical clocks on three processes, which communicate via interprocess communcation.
#   Handles simulation of multithreading by pulling from interprocess communication queues at clock tick time, and then
#   adjusting the waiting time between ticks so that work is done every 1/ticks_per_second seconds.
#   You can confirm that this works by looking at the clock values in the outputted log files.
